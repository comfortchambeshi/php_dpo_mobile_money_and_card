# Card Payment Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Card Payment Processing
- Added card payment handling in `submit.inc.php` 
- Processes card details (number, expiry, CVV, cardholder name)
- Validates card input fields
- Calls DPO Pay API for card transactions

### 2. Enhanced DPO Class (`classes/dpo.php`)
- Fixed `chargeTokenCreditCard` method
- Removed hardcoded 3D Secure data that was causing failures
- Added proper error handling and response parsing
- Implemented test/production mode switching
- Added detailed error messages for different response codes

### 3. Updated HTML Form (`pay.php`)
- Added proper `name` attributes to all card form fields
- Added form validation and required attributes
- Improved card number formatting (spaces every 4 digits)
- Added CVV validation (digits only)
- Enhanced JavaScript for dynamic form validation

### 4. Enhanced Processing Page (`inc/submit.inc.php`)
- Added comprehensive input validation
- Different status messages for mobile money vs card payments
- Better error handling with specific error messages
- Conditional JavaScript execution based on payment success

## Key Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: 999 Transaction Declined Error
**Problem**: Hardcoded 3D Secure data and wrong success logic
**Solution**: 
- Removed 3D Secure section for basic card payments
- Fixed response parsing to check actual result codes
- Added test/production mode configuration

### Issue 2: Form Validation
**Problem**: Missing validation and poor user experience  
**Solution**:
- Added client-side and server-side validation
- Required field validation
- Card number and CVV formatting
- Proper error messages

### Issue 3: Configuration Management
**Problem**: Hard to switch between test and production
**Solution**:
- Added configuration methods
- Easy test/production mode switching
- Proper credential management

## Current Configuration

- **Mode**: Test Mode (enabled)
- **Test Credentials**: Using DPO test environment
- **Card Numbers**: Use test card numbers only (see test_cards.md)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to**: `pay.php`
2. **Enter amount**: Any positive number
3. **Select payment method**: "Card"
4. **Use test card details**:
   - Card Number: 4000000000000002
   - Expiry Month: 12
   - Expiry Year: 2026
   - CVV: 123
   - Cardholder Name: Test User
5. **Submit form**
6. **Expected result**: Should redirect to processing page and show transaction status

## Switching to Production

To switch to production mode:

```php
// In classes/dpo.php, change:
private static $isTestMode = false;
```

**Important**: Only use real card numbers in production mode!

## File Changes Made

1. `/classes/dpo.php` - Enhanced DPO API integration
2. `/inc/submit.inc.php` - Added card payment processing  
3. `/pay.php` - Improved form validation and UX
4. `/test_cards.md` - Added testing documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test with the provided test card numbers
2. Verify transaction flow works end-to-end
3. When ready for production, switch test mode to false
4. Test with small real transactions before going live

The implementation now properly handles both mobile money and card payments according to the DPO Pay API documentation.
